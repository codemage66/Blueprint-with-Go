please let us know if anything feels wrong or incomplete.

## Guidelines

### Issues

Any significant improvement should be added as a GitHub issue so we can
discuss.

Please submit issues to the correct repositories:

- [Blueprint](https://github.com/blue-jay/blueprint/issues) - issues
related to the Blueprint source code
- [Jay](https://github.com/blue-jay/jay/issues) - issues related to
the Jay source code

the Core source code

- issues related to the BlueJay website or documentation

When submitting a issue, please answer these questions:

- Which commit are you using?
- Which operating system, processor architecture, and Go version are you using?
- What did you do?
- What did you expect to see?
- What did you actually see?

### Pull Requests

Send your pull request to the **master** branch with an explanation so
we can merge it quickly.

Any small changes like typo fixes are also worth a pull request.

Please separate out features and fixes into individual pull requests
and reference the issue if it exists.

Things like typos fixes can be grouped together into a single pull
request.
