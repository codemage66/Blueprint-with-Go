Blue Jay is a web toolkit for [Go](https://golang.org/). It's a collection of
command-line tools and a web blueprint that allows you to easily structure
your web application. There is no rigid framework to which you have to
conform.

There are a few components:

- [**Blueprint**](https://github.com/blue-jay/blueprint) is a
model-view-controller (MVC) style web skeleton.

- [**Jay**](https://github.com/blue-jay/jay) is a command-line tool with
modules for find/replace, database migrations, code generation, and env.json.

- [**Core**](https://github.com/blue-jay/core) is a collection of packages
available to Blueprint and Jay as well as other applications.
